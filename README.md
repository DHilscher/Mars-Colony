My first Angular project! This was a fun project based on a Mars Colony needing to register jobs and report Alien encounters.

I used Angular 2 with scss to create this SPA.

I learned how to navigate through multiple pages without reloading browser.

I also learned how to POST to a api.

I learned components file structure and how components/models/services work together.

I also learned about using routes in Angular.

Angular 2 is a very good framework for troubleshooting. I really enjoyed the way it displays errors and its ability to show you the options you have to type next.
